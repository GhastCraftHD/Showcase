**Showcase** is a tool which makes it much easier to work with **Item Displays**.

Item Displays were added in **Minecraft 1.19.4** and are an easy and performant way to **display items** in your Minecraft worlds. One of their biggest advantages is that you can **change their size and rotation**.

Item Displays are not the only type of Display entities that were added in 1.19.4. For the other ones I have created **separate plugins**:
* Block Displays: [Miniaturise](https://hangar.papermc.io/GhastCraftHD/Miniaturise)
* Text Displays: [Holography](https://hangar.papermc.io/GhastCraftHD/Holography)

  You can alter the default configuration by changing the values of the `config.yml` file in the plugins data folder.

If you donâ€™t want to enable the plugin everytime you join your server you can change enabled-by-default from `false` to `true`.

```yaml
check-for-update: true
enabled-by-default: false
default-transform: FIXED
tool: AMETHYST_SHARD
```

By default only server operators are able to use Showcase. If you want to give other players the right to use Showcase you need to grant them the permission `showcase.use`

To spawn a new Item Display simply put the item you want to be displayed in your hand and drop it while sneaking.

To adjust the position, size or rotation of your miniature you can use the adjuster tool (amethyst shard by default) together with the adjuster interface.
You can open the adjuster interface by holding the adjuster tool in your hand, sneak and right click.

To select/deselect an Item Display simply hold the adjuster tool in your hand and hit it while sneaking.

To remove an Item Display simply click the barrier in the adjuster interface.

Some of these images contain **custom models**. These models are **not** included in Showcase and were only used to demonstrate **use cases** and the **abilities of Showcase**. If you wish to acquire them you can do so [here](https://mcmodels.net/products/8776/nogs-plushies-megapack)
